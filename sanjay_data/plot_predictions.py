"""
This script will be used for trying to compute precision/recall stuff. I don't
think I can do this entirely automatically as I have to inspect the images.
Based on Sanjay's script. Looks like there are 13 data directories ("trials"),
each of which has 8 "centroid" images.

Some notes:

9scIg, LXBGm, mWMuP, bQ1W1, esaQA, mPjNp
    We should remove all of the first column from consideration. I just
    inspected these to see which ones clearly should not have been used, which
    is what we would do in practice anyway.
